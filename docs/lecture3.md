# Makefiles

## Dependency Management

- How to determine which files have changed?

![makefile-dependencies](image/lecture3/build-deps.svg)

- **dependencies**: `main.o` depends on changes in `lib.h`

## Makefile

- A `Makefile` uses a declarative language to describe targets and their dependencies.

- It is executed by the `make` command, which allows building different **targets**.

  - `make` uses timestamps to determine which files have changed.

  - `make` evaluates rules recursively to satisfy dependencies.

## Makefile Rule

```Makefile
prog: main.c lib.c lib.h
  clang -o prog main.c lib.c -lm

target: dependencies
\t  command to build the target from the dependencies
```

## Separate Compilation

```Makefile
prog: main.o lib.o
  clang -o prog main.o lib.o -lm

main.o: main.c lib.h
  clang -c -o main.o main.c

lib.o: lib.c lib.h
  clang -c -o lib.o lib.c
```

If `lib.c` is modified, which commands will be executed?

## Phony Targets

You can add targets that do not correspond to a produced file. For example, it is useful to add a `clean` target to clean the project.

```Makefile
clean:
  rm -f *.o prog
.PHONY: clean
```

`.PHONY` specifies that the `clean` rule should always be executed. Declaring all phony targets ensures they are always called (even if a file with the same name is created).

## Default Rule

```bash
make clean
make prog
make
```

- If `make` is called with a rule, that rule is built.
- If `make` is called without arguments, the first rule is built. It is customary to include a default `all:` rule as the first rule.

```Makefile
all: prog

prog: ...
```

## Variables

```Makefile
CC=clang
CFLAGS=-O2
LDFLAGS=-lm

prog: main.o lib.o
  $(CC) -o prog main.o lib.o $(LDFLAGS)

main.o: main.c lib.h
  $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o main.o main.c

lib.o: lib.c lib.h
  $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o lib.o lib.c
```

Variables can be overridden when calling `make`, e.g.,

```bash
make CC=gcc
```

## Special Variables

----  ------------------------
`$@`  target name
`$^`  all dependencies
`$<`  first dependency
----  ------------------------

```Makefile
prog: main.o lib.o
  $(CC)  -o $@ $^ $(LDFLAGS)

main.o: main.c lib.h
  $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

lib.o: lib.c lib.h
  $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $< 
```

The last two rules are very similar...

## Implicit Rules

### Before

```Makefile
main.o: main.c lib.h
  $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

lib.o: lib.c lib.h
  $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $< 
```

### With Implicit Rule

```Makefile
%.o: %.c
  $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

main.o: lib.h
lib.o: lib.h
```

## Other Build Systems

- **automake / autoconf**: automatic generation of complex makefiles and management of system-specific configurations.

- **cmake, scons**: successors to Makefile, offering more elegant syntax and new features.

# CMake

## Why CMake?

- **Advantages of Makefiles:**
  - Simplicity and transparency.
  - No additional tools required.
  - Direct control over the build process.

- **Advantages of CMake:**
  - Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS).
  - Generates build files for multiple build systems (Make, Ninja, etc.).
  - Modular and target-based design.
  - Built-in support for testing, installation, and packaging.

## General Design of CMake

- **CMake as a Meta-Build System:**
  - Generates build files for different generators (e.g., Make, Ninja).
  - Abstracts platform-specific details.

- **Workflow:**
  1. Write `CMakeLists.txt` to define the project.
  2. Configure the project:

     ```sh
     cmake -B build
     ```

  3. Build the project:

     ```sh
     cmake --build build
     # or when using Make as backend
     make -C build
     ```

  **Out-of-source builds** are recommended to keep source directories clean.

## Basic Structure of `CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(MyProject LANGUAGES C)

set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)
```

- **`cmake_minimum_required`:** Specifies the minimum version of CMake required.
- **`project`:** Defines the project name and the programming language(s) used.
- **`set`:** Sets variables, e.g., C standard version.

## Adding an Executable

```cmake
add_executable(my_executable src/main.c)
```

- Creates an executable named `my_executable`.

## Adding a Shared Library

```cmake
add_library(my_library SHARED src/library.c)
```

- Creates a shared library named `libmy_library.so` (on Linux).

## Linking Libraries to Executables

```cmake
add_library(my_library SHARED src/library.c)
add_executable(my_executable src/main.c)
target_link_libraries(my_executable PRIVATE my_library)
```

- **`add_library`:** Creates a shared library.
- **`add_executable`:** Creates an executable.
- **`target_link_libraries`:** Links the library to the executable.

PRIVATE means that `my_executable` uses `my_library`, but `my_library` does not need to be linked when other targets link to `my_executable`.

## Library dependency transitivity

```cmake
add_library(libA SHARED src/libA.c)
add_library(libB SHARED src/libB.c)
target_link_libraries(libB PUBLIC libA)
add_executable(my_executable src/main.c)
target_link_libraries(my_executable PRIVATE libB)
```

- `my_executable` is linked to `libB` and also to `libA` because `libB` links to `libA` with `PUBLIC`.
- If `libB` linked to `libA` with `PRIVATE`, `my_executable` would not be linked to `libA`.
- If `libB` linked to `libA` with `INTERFACE`, `my_executable` would be linked to `libA` but not `libB`.
- See [this reference](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html) for more details.

## Global Include Directories

```cmake
include_directories(include)
```

- Adds the `include` directory globally for all targets.
- **Limitation:** Can lead to conflicts in larger projects.

## Target-Specific Include Directories

```cmake
target_include_directories(my_library
    PUBLIC include
)
```

- **PUBLIC:** Include directory is needed when building and using the library.
- **PRIVATE:** Include directory is needed only when building the library.
- **INTERFACE:** Include directory is needed only when using the library.

## Porting our minimal Makefile example to CMake

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(MyProject LANGUAGES C)

# Add the executable target
add_executable(prog main.c lib.c)

# Specify include directories for the target
target_include_directories(prog 
  PRIVATE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})

# Add compile options
target_compile_options(prog PRIVATE ${CFLAGS})

# Link libraries if needed
target_link_libraries(prog PRIVATE m)
```

## Debug vs Release Builds

- **Debug Build:**
  - Includes debug symbols for debugging.
  - Example flags: `-g`, `-O0`.

- **Release Build:**
  - Optimized for performance.
  - Example flags: `-O3`, `-DNDEBUG`.

## Setting Build Types in CMake

```cmake
if(NOT CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE)
  set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE RelWithDebInfo CACHE STRING "Build type" FORCE)
endif()
```

- Build types: `Debug`, `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo`, `MinSizeRel`.

- CACHE: Makes the variable persistent across CMake runs. In out-of-source builds `CMakeLists.txt` is not re-evaluated on subsequent runs.
- FORCE: Overrides any previous value.
- STRING: "Build type" provides a description in CMake GUI.

## Adding Compiler Flags

```cmake
target_compile_options(my_library PRIVATE
    $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:-g -Wall>
    $<$<CONFIG:Release>:-O3 -DNDEBUG>
)
```

- **Generator Expressions:** `$<CONFIG:Debug>` applies flags only for Debug builds.

## Installing Targets

```cmake
install(TARGETS my_library
    LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
    PUBLIC_HEADER DESTINATION include
)
```

- Installs the shared library to the `lib` directory.
- Installs public headers to the `include` directory.

## Using GNUInstallDirs

```cmake
include(GNUInstallDirs)

install(TARGETS my_library
    LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}
    PUBLIC_HEADER DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}
)
```

- Defines standard GNU library and include directories paths.

## Generating and Building the Project

1. **Configure the Project:**

   ```sh
   cmake -B build
   ```

   - Generates build files in the `build` directory.

2. **Build the Project:**

   ```sh
   cmake --build build
   # or when using Make as backend
   make -C build
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**

   ```sh
   ./build/my_executable
   ```

## Best Practices for CMake

- **Use Target-Based Commands:**
  - Prefer `target_include_directories` over `include_directories`.
  - Prefer `target_link_libraries` over global linking.

- **Organize `CMakeLists.txt`:**
  - Group related targets together.
  - Use comments to explain sections.

- **Avoid Global Commands:**
  - Avoid `include_directories` and `link_libraries` globally.

- **Use Modern CMake Features:**
  - Generator expressions for conditional configurations.
  - `FetchContent` for managing external dependencies.

# Debugging Tools

## GDB: GNU Debugger

## Valgrind: memory debugging and leak detection

## Other tools: ASAN, UBSAN

# Software Testing

## Importance of Software Testing

- 1996: Ariane-5 self-destructed due to an unhandled floating-point exception, resulting in a \$500M loss.
- 1998: Mars Climate Orbiter lost due to navigation data expressed in imperial units, resulting in a \$327.6M loss.
- 1988-1994: FAA Advanced Automation System project abandoned due to management issues and overly ambitious specifications, resulting in a \$2.6B loss.
- 1985-1987: Therac-25 medical accelerator malfunctioned due to a thread concurrency issue, causing five deaths and numerous injuries.

## Verification and Validation (V&V)

- **Validation**: Does the software meet the client's needs?  
  - "Are we building the right product?"

- **Verification**: Does the software work correctly?  
  - "Are we building the product right?"

## Approaches to Verification

- Formal methods
- Modeling and simulations
- Code reviews
- **Testing**

## Testing Process

## V Cycle Model

![V-Model: Validation followed by Verification](image/lecture3/vcycle.svg)

## Different Types of Tests

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test individual functions in isolation.
  - Test-driven development (TDD): Focus on writing maintainable, simple, and decoupled code.

- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test the correct behavior when combining modules.
  - Validate only functional correctness.

- **Validation Tests:**
  - Test compliance with specifications.
  - Test other characteristics: performance, security, etc.

- **Acceptance Tests:**
  - Validate requirements with the client.

- **Regression Tests:**
  - Ensure that fixed bugs do not reappear.

## Black-Box and White-Box Testing

### Black-Box Testing (Functional)

- Tests are generated from specifications.
- Uses assumptions different from the programmer's.
- Tests are independent of implementation.
- Difficult to find programming defects.

### White-Box Testing (Structural)

- Tests are generated from source code.
- Maximizes coverage by testing all code branches.
- Difficult to find omission or specification errors.

Both approaches are complementary.

## What to Test?

- Running the program on all possible inputs is too costly.
- Choose a subset of inputs:
  - Partition inputs into equivalence classes to maximize coverage.
  - Test all code branches.
  - Test edge cases.
  - Test invalid cases.
  - Test combinations (experimental design).

## Example of Partitioning (1/3)

### Specification

```c
/* compare returns:
 *   0 if a is equal to b
 *   1 if a is strictly greater than b
 *  -1 if a is strictly less than b
 */
int compare (int a, int b);
```

What inputs should be tested?

## Equivalence Classes (2/3)

| Variable | Possible Values            |
|----------|----------------------------|
| a        | {positive, negative, zero} |
| b        | {positive, negative, zero} |
| result   |                 {0, 1, -1} |

### Example Test Cases

| a   | b   | result |
|-----|-----|--------|
| 10  | 10  | 0      |
| 20  | 5   | 1      |
| 3   | 7   | -1     |
| -30 | -30 | 0      |
| -5  | -10 | 1      |
| ... | ... | ...    |

It is possible to select a subset of classes!

## Boundary Tests (3/3)

|a          | b  | result
|-----------|----|-------
|-2147483648|-1  | -1

## Discussion

- Automatic test generation.
- Test coverage calculation.
- Mutation testing.
- Fuzzing.
- Importance of using automated testing tools.
- Importance of using continuous integration tools.


# Unity Test Framework

## Introduction to Unity

  ![Unity Logo](image/lecture3/unity-slim.png)

  [Unity Test Framework](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity)

  - Lightweight and simple unit testing framework for C.
  - Designed for embedded systems but can be used in any C project.
  - Provides a set of macros and functions to define and run tests.
  

## Setting Up Unity 

- Separate Unity tests into a separate directory, e.g., `tests/`. 

- Include the Unity header in your test files:

  ```c
  #include "unity.h"
  ```

- Requires linking against the Unity library
- We will link against a static library `libunity.a`, since Unity uses CMake, we will use FetchContent to add it to our projects.

## Writing Tests

- test_functions use `TEST` macros provided by Unity to assert conditions.

  ```c
  void test_function_name(void) {
      ...
      TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_INT(expected, actual);
      TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL(pointer);
      TEST_ASSERT_TRUE(condition);
      ... 
  }
  ```

- Reference for all assertions: [Unity Assertions](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity/blob/master/docs/UnityAssertionsReference.md)

## Running Tests

- Create a test runner function to execute all tests:

  ```c
  int main(void) ## Boundary Tests{
      UNITY_BEGIN();
      RUN_TEST(test_function_name);
      ...
      return UNITY_END();
  }
  ```

## SetUp and TearDown

- SetUp and TearDown functions can be defined to run before and after each test.

  ```c
  void setUp(void) {
      // Code to run before each test
  }

  void tearDown(void) {
      // Code to run after each test
  }
  ```

## Code Coverage with unit tests

- Use `gcov` or `llvm-cov` to measure code coverage of your tests.
- Compile your code with coverage flags:

  ```sh
  gcc --coverage -g -O0 -o test_runner test_runner.c my_code.c -lunity
  ```

- gcov instruments the basic blocks of code to record what is executed during tests.

- gcovr generate HTML reports showing which parts of the code were covered by tests.
