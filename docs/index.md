# GLHPC - Introduction

This course is intended for M1 Calcul Haute Performance et simulation (M1CHPS) students as a crash course for programming techniques specific to High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence applications.
This course will cover programming basics in C and shell, and will gradually move on to more complex notions such as parallelism, performance profiling, experimental design, and the implementation of a Neural Network from scratch.

## Organisation

This course is organised as a mixture of lectures and labs. The lectures are available online in the Course section of this website, and may be provided as slides by your professor.

The labs subjects are contained in the same section, but code snippets and other ressources will be provided via github classroom.

## Advanced content

Some of you may come from a CS background and already have strong notions of C programming. This course includes Advanced and optionnal sections to keep you busy during class hours.
