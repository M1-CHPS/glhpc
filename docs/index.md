# GLHPC - Introduction

This course is intended for M1 Calcul Haute Performance et simulation (M1CHPS)
students as a crash course for software engineering targetting High Performance
Computing and Artificial Intelligence applications.

This course will cover programming basics in C and shell, software engineering
best practices, and will gradually move on to more complex notions such as
parallelism, performance profiling, experimental design, and the implementation
of a Neural Network inference engince from scratch.

## Advanced optional tasks

This course starts from the basics as some of the students come from applied
maths and physics backgrounds. For those of you, who already have a good
programming background, we have included optional advanced tasks in each lab to
deepen your knowledge. You are not required to do them, but you are strongly
encouraged.
