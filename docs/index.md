# OBHPC - Remise a niveau informatique

This course is intended for M1CHPS students as a computer-science crash course. 
We will cover the very basics that you will need to thrive during the Master, including a dense introduction to programming,
experimental design, and performance analysis of HPC kernels.

## Organisation

This course is organized in labs contaning a mix of lessons and exercises that you will need to complete.

## Advanced content

Some you may come from a CS background, and may find the content of this course trivial: this is normal, and I do expect you to still complete the exercises. However, the course also includes **[Going-Further]** sections that you may find more interesting.
